## A Little Overview of the problem:

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we were asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## A brief walkthrough through what I did:

• Visualized plots for each and every feature with the response variable to gain in-depth understanding of how they fluctuate with respect to each other
• In-depth walkthrough of each and every feature 
• Data Wrangling
• New features added to gain more insights from the dataset
• Maxiziming the accuracy through various parameter tuning in the Random Forest model
• Leveraged parallelization for training the Random Forest model with 1000 trees

Overall accuracy of around 81.57% is achieved.
